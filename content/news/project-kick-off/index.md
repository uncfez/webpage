In October 2021, with the participation of the coordinators of the three subprojects, the **Kick-off meeting** was held in a virtual meeting. The summary of the previous project: **Robustness, efficiency and recovery of public transport systems** (TRA2016-76914-C3), in which the same teams collaborated, was reviewed.


The results of this previous project establish the starting point of the current project, with the acronym **Acosemsustran**. In this new project, the developments previously achieved will be extended through the **coordinated** and **complementary** application of **machine learning** technologies and a**rtificial intelligence** to the **operational research models** developed in the planning and management of **urban mobility** and **rail** and **air transport**.
